# Biography

I am a PhD student from Dept. of Computer Science at IUB. I am mostly working with Prof. Qin Zhang. Before coming to IUB, I studied math and computer science at University of Minnesota and did my senior project under Prof. [Sergey Bobkov](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~bobko001/). I also worked for Wolfram Research, Google Ads and Google AI.
